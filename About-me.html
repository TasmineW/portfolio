<h1>About my Life</h1>
<blockquote><q>Full time student, full time worker.</q></blockquote>
<p> My name is Tasmine Watler. I as named after the Tasmanian devil cartoon because I was
wild in the womb. I lived in Washington my whole life. Currently I am a 21 year old man-child.
I say that I am a man child-because I still live with my parents in Olympia, Washington. I am a Team
Leader at Jack in the Box even though I used to call myself "The Grillmaster", I mostly work on the
Customer service area now. Originally I started working at Jack in the Box in Lacey, Washington while
I was in high school. Three years later there was some conflict, I decided to find a new job because I didn't get
along with the boss. A new job lead me to work multiple jobs. Eventually I decided to work at the downtown Olympia
Jack in the box because I knew that I would get the hours that I wanted. I don't regret going back to Jack. Without
Jack in the Box I wouldn't be able to afford my education or my car. Despite many work changes I was able to get my high school
diploma and my associates degree. I am currently attending the University of Washington to get a certificate in
web development. I enjoy using computers and I don't see myself making sandwiched for the rest of my life.
and my associates in arts.
